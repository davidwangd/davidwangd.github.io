## Welcome to davidwang's Blog

### Prolog

I've been suffering a tough time of my life and academic career (career may be an embellished word since I have not obtained my Ph.D. degree yet) since the COVID-19 pandemic.
I think I'm still living under the shadow of the block-down during Dec. 2022 even two years has been passed. To get rid of the depression, I decided to make some change. So I picked up this github's blog server. I'm not expecting anyone to find, or follow this. But still, I will give an effort to write down some of my thinking about Programming, Research, and Meaning of life.

Currently, the blog will have at least three parts:

+ My thought of Programming, especially in modern C++ and Haskell.
+ My personal essay: some memorable events or thought of life.
+ Interesting gaming event.

Most of the blogs will be writtern in simplified Chinese.
